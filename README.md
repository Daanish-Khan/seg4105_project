  ## Project Description
The Mikado Machine is a webapp aimed towards software developers and/or project managers. The app takes inspiration from the Mikado Method, a software development methodology that is used to help organize dependencies and relationships between parts of a system. It also prioritizes changes that are not blocked by any other tasks, allowing for easy orginization of tasks and automatically creates an easy to follow workflow. The Mikado Method is usually done with pen and paper, but this app intends to create a platform where this can be done electronically.
