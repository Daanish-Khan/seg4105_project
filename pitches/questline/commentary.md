## Feasibility

- Keeping the graph and the quest system in sync may be a problem
- How that long horizontal questline be drawn on a mobile screen?
- How will equally valid next steps in symmetrical graphs have one next step be chosen?
- You are trying to put the overlay where the FAB currently is

## Additional rabbit holes

- Any kind of trying to be smart and trying to do caching
- Making the questline be aware of subgraph contents, especially since nesting can be infinite
- Showing multiple next tasks in the overview or the questline screen, becoming a slippery slope
- The quest view screen is redundant and may lead to more and more duplicate views of the same data being added

## Overall thoughts

- Are we sure most people will / will be made to use this?
- That horizontal quest tree example looks a bit ugly
- The feature idea looks quite cool
